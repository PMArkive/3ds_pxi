# 3ds_pxi
Open source replacement of the ARM11 PXI system module -- **not working yet**

This is licensed under the MIT license.

# Compilation and usage
You'll need the latest commits of [ctrulib](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib) and [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR/tree/master/makerom) ([here]() is a Windows build of makerom).

To run this system module, use a recent commit of [Luma3DS-dev](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/tree/developer) and copy pxi.cxi to /luma/sysmodules/.
